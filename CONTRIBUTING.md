# How to Contribute

The easiest ways to contribute is to open an issue and start a discussion. 
Then we can decided if and how a feature or a change could be implemented and if you should submit a pull requests with code changes. Please start all discussions on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/DavidParks8/Owin-Authorization/issues).


## Filing Issues
The best way to get your bug fixed is to be as detailed as you can be about the problem.
Here are questions you can answer before you file a bug to make sure you're not missing any important information.

1. Did you read the [documentation](https://github.com/DavidParks8/Owin-Authorization/wiki)?
2. Did you include the snippet of broken code in the issue?
3. What are the *EXACT* steps to reproduce this problem?

GitHub supports [markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/), so when filing bugs make sure you check the formatting before clicking submit.

## Contributing Code and Content
Make sure you can build the code and that it follows our [engineering guidelines](ENGINEERING-GUIDE.md). Familiarize yourself with the project workflow and our coding conventions. If you don't know what a pull request is read this article: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests.

**We only accept pull requests to the dev branch.**

Before submitting a feature or substantial code contribution please discuss it with the team and ensure it follows the product roadmap. Here's a list of blog posts that are worth reading before doing a pull request:

Here's a few things you should always do when making changes to the code base:

**Tests**

-  Tests need to be provided for every bug/feature that is completed.
-  If there is a scenario that is far too hard to test there does not need to be a test for it.
  - "Too hard" is determined by the team as a whole.
